# Introduction to Kubernetes Workloads
Workloads are the workhorses of your Kubernetes cluster.  
Rancher collects all of the varied configuration options for the different types of Kubernetes resources into a single UI panel, making it quick and easy to
launch operational workloads.

Rancherâ€™s strength comes from taking complex actions that take place in multiple locations within Kubernetes and consolidating them into an easy, intuitive interface.  
Workload management fits this model perfectly.

Presenting options in a UI reduces the risk of human error and minimizes the amount of work needed to accomplish a task. Rather than looking in multiple places and collecting data to manually transcribe into a different manifest, Rancher shows you all of the options available for resources like PVCs, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and other items and lets you quickly and confidently launch Kubernetes workloads.
