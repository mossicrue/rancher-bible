# Project Logging
Logging at the project level works exactly like logging at the cluster level.  
Teams who wish to have their projects log to their own services can configure an endpoint independent of any cluster configuration.

# Set up Project logging separated to Cluster level logging

- Navigate to the "Cluster" details page using the Cluster selection dropdown menu and choose the Project you want to monitor

- Now, from the dropdown menu click "Tools" and select "Logging"

- In the page, choose the Logging service, for example Elasticsearch

- Now fill the forms with the requested data

- When the configuration is finished click on "Save"
